Title: Solving the Maximum Length Difference JavaScript Challenge

Intro

Hey everyone, welcome back to another JavaScript challenge video. Today, we're going to tackle a problem involving arrays and strings. Specifically, we're tasked with finding the maximum absolute difference in lengths between two strings, one from each of two arrays.

Problem Explanation

So, we have two arrays, a1 and a2, each containing strings composed of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. Our goal is to find the maximum absolute difference between the lengths of any two strings, one from each array.

Example Demonstration

Let's start by understanding the problem with an example. Given arrays a1 and a2:
We need to find the maximum absolute difference in lengths between any two strings, one from a1 and one from a2.

Approach Explanation

To solve this problem, we'll follow a straightforward approach:

First, we'll handle the edge case where either a1 or a2 is empty. In JavaScript, we'll return -1 in this case.
Next, we'll iterate through each pair of strings, one from a1 and one from a2, calculating the absolute difference in their lengths.
Finally, we'll return the maximum of all these differences.
Code Implementation

Now, let's dive into the code and implement this solution in JavaScript.

Conclusion

And there we have it! We've successfully solved the maximum length difference problem in JavaScript. Feel free to try out different inputs and test the function yourself.
